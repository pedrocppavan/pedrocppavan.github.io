### Professional Achievement: Microsoft Success Case

As the Business Intelligence Leader and Finance and Controllership Specialist at Baptista Luz Advogados, I led a digital transformation journey centered on process automation and data-driven decision-making. By implementing **Microsoft Power BI** and **Power Query**, we successfully transitioned from manual reporting to an automated, integrated ecosystem.

This initiative addressed the critical need for granular performance tracking across lawyers, practice areas, projects, and clients. By establishing a direct connection to our databases and leveraging automated data preparation, we achieved a "revolution in our workflow," delivering high-fidelity insights and optimizing the financial management through a comprehensive, results-oriented business vision. This project was officially recognized by **Microsoft** as a success case in the legal sector.
