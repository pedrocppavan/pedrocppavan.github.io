I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Business Administration (Finance) at the Sao Paulo School of Business Administration (EAESP FGV), under the advisement of Professor Wesley Mendes da Silva. I also hold a Master's degree in Finance and Controllership (2020) and an Executive MBA (2013) from the same institution. Previously, I received my B.A. in Economics from PUC-SP (2005). My current CV can be found [here](/files/CV_Pedro_Pavan_2026.pdf).


When I'm not researching, you can find me playing basketball, fishing or traveling.
