I am a **Ph.D. Candidate in Finance** at FGV EAESP, where I earned my Master’s in Finance and an Executive MBA.

Advised by **[Professor Wesley Mendes](https://mendesdasilva.com/)**, my research focuses on **Sustainable Finance**, building upon prior studies in Institutional Investor Ownership and Corporate Governance. My work has been published in [Emerging Markets Finance and Trade](https://doi.org/10.1080/1540496X.2023.2218967) and presented at the [EIBA Conference](/files/EIBA 2021 Certificate.pdf) in Madrid.

I have served as a graduate-level teaching assistant and I am a specialist in financial databases, with extensive experience in LSEG Eikon, Bloomberg, Factset, and S&P Capital IQ.
